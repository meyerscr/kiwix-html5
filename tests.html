        Depending on the browser you use, you should launch these unit tests differently : <br/>
        <ul>
            <li>Open this page from a file:/// URL for Firefox (for a reason I have to find, there's an error when running from an http://localhost URL)</li>
            <li>Open this page from a http:// URL for Chromium/Chrome (through a local webserver, for example), because it does not allow to run a web worker from a file:/// URL</li>
        </ul>
        <div id="qunit"></div>
    </body>
